<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Hair Transplantation Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Follicular Unit Transplantation (FUT)</li><li>Follicular Unit Extraction (FUE)</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The hair transplantation market primarily consists of two types: Follicular Unit Transplantation (FUT) and Follicular Unit Extraction (FUE). FUT involves removing a strip of scalp with hair follicles, which are then dissected and implanted in thinning or balding areas, offering a high yield of grafts. In contrast, FUE extracts individual hair follicles directly from the scalp using minimally invasive techniques, resulting in quicker recovery and less scarring. Both methods cater to different patient preferences and varying degrees of hair loss.</p></p>
