<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Hair Transplant Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Follicular Unit Transplantation (FUT)</li><li>Follicular Unit Extraction (FUE)</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The hair transplant market primarily consists of two types: Follicular Unit Transplantation (FUT) and Follicular Unit Extraction (FUE). FUT involves removing a strip of scalp containing hair follicles, which are then dissected and transplanted to thinning areas, resulting in a linear scar. In contrast, FUE extracts individual hair follicles directly from the scalp using a specialized tool, avoiding the linear scar and allowing for quicker recovery. Both methods cater to varying patient needs, preferences, and levels of hair loss.</p></p>
