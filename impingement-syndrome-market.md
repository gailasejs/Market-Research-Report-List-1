<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Impingement Syndrome Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Structural Impingement</li><li>Functional Impingement</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Impingement syndrome refers to the painful condition resulting from the compression of shoulder structures. The market is segmented into two main types: structural impingement and functional impingement. Structural impingement involves anatomical anomalies, such as bone spurs or acromion shape, leading to mechanical obstruction. In contrast, functional impingement arises from altered movement patterns or muscle imbalances, affecting the shoulder's biomechanics. Both types drive demand for treatment options, including physical therapy, surgical interventions, and rehabilitation products tailored to address specific causes.</p></p>
