<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Allergy Immunotherapy Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Subcutaneous Immunotherapy</li><li>Sublingual Immunotherapy</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Allergy immunotherapy includes subcutaneous immunotherapy (SCIT) and sublingual immunotherapy (SLIT). SCIT involves administering allergen extracts through injections, gradually increasing doses to desensitize the immune system over time. This method is typically used for allergies to pollen, dust mites, and certain foods. In contrast, SLIT involves placing allergen tablets or drops under the tongue, offering a more convenient, self-administered alternative with potentially fewer side effects. Both methods aim to reduce allergy symptoms and improve quality of life for patients.</p></p>
