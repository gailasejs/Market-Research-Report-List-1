<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Neonatal Warming Equipment Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Radiation Heating</li><li>Electrical Heating</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The neonatal warming equipment market encompasses two primary types: radiation heating and electrical heating. Radiation heating devices, such as radiant warmers, provide a controlled, warm environment by emitting infrared heat directly onto the infant, minimizing heat loss. In contrast, electrical heating systems, including incubators, use heated air to create a stable temperature around the newborn, ensuring consistent warmth and protection from external conditions. Both types are essential in neonatal care to support vulnerable infants during critical development stages.</p></p>
